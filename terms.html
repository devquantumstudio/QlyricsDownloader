				<h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
				<p>
					<small>Last updated: <time id="lastUpdated"></time></small>
				</p>

				<p>Welcome to <strong>Qlyrics Downloader</strong>. By using this app, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.</p>

				<h2 id="use">1. Permitted Use</h2>
				<p>
					This app is intended for personal, educational, or accessibility-related use — such as music study, karaoke, or transcription. You must only use the app with audio content or metadata that you have the legal right to
					process. You are responsible for ensuring that your use complies with local laws and third-party terms.
				</p>

				<h2 id="responsibility">2. Responsibility &amp; Prohibited Uses</h2>
				<p>
					You are solely responsible for how you use this tool. The app is provided as-is, for lawful purposes only. You may not use the app to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Infringe copyright:</strong> Do not use the app to download or distribute copyrighted lyrics without permission.</li>
					<li><strong>Scrape or bypass access controls:</strong> Do not use automated methods to extract data from sources that prohibit scraping.</li>
					<li><strong>Access restricted or unauthorized material:</strong> Only use content you are allowed to access and process.</li>
					<li><strong>Distribute harmful content:</strong> Do not use the app for malicious purposes such as spreading malware or hate speech.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>We do not endorse or accept responsibility for how the app is used.</strong> You bear full responsibility for any content you retrieve, enter, or download using the app.</p>

				<p>
					<em>Values statement.</em> This project is offered freely and in good faith as a technical tool. We explicitly disown any use of the app that goes against God’s law — including the promotion of immorality, hate, atheism, or homosexuality. Such use is contrary to our values and beliefs, and we reject it both now and in the future, including on the Day of Judgment. Responsibility for all usage rests solely with the user.
				</p>

				<h2 id="ip">3. Intellectual Property</h2>
				<p>
					The app’s interface, source code, and design are the intellectual property of the developers. Any lyrics retrieved remain the property of their respective copyright holders. We do not claim ownership over lyrics or audio
					files you use with the app.
				</p>

				<h2 id="lyric-sources">4. Lyric Sources</h2>
				<p>
					The app uses public or licensed APIs to search for and retrieve lyrics based on metadata you provide (e.g., artist name, track title, or audio file metadata). We do not control these external sources and cannot guarantee
					the accuracy, availability, or legality of their content.
				</p>
				<p>
					Use of such content is at your own discretion and risk. You are responsible for reviewing and complying with the terms of any lyric provider or data source.
				</p>

				<h2 id="availability">5. Availability &amp; Changes</h2>
				<p>
					The app runs locally on your device and may be updated or changed at any time without notice. We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue features at our sole discretion.
				</p>

				<h2 id="disclaimer">6. Disclaimers</h2>
				<p>
					This app is provided <em>“as is”</em> and <em>“as available”</em>, with no warranties of any kind, express or implied. This includes but is not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
					and non-infringement. We do not guarantee accuracy, completeness, or availability of lyrics.
				</p>

				<h2 id="liability">7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
				<p>
					To the fullest extent allowed by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages resulting from your use of the app.
				</p>
				<p>If liability cannot be excluded, our total liability will not exceed <strong>USD 0 (zero)</strong>. Donations are treated as unconditional gifts and do not increase our liability or create service obligations.</p>
				<p>Some jurisdictions may not allow certain exclusions or limitations. These apply only as permitted by law in your location.</p>

				<h2 id="termination">8. Termination</h2>
				<p>
					We may restrict or terminate your access to the app if you violate these Terms or applicable law. We reserve the right to take appropriate legal action in case of misuse.
				</p>

				<h2 id="law">9. Governing Law &amp; Compliance</h2>

					We do not assign a governing jurisdiction. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of the app complies with the laws and regulations of your country or region.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any legal dispute related to your use of the app shall be resolved in your local jurisdiction under applicable local laws.
